## Description

This is a repository for an application that automates the process of creating a README file based on user input. The application was created in order to quickly generate a professional README file to save valuable time that can be used to continue/complete development. Users will be prompted to answer questions using the command line and a README file will be generated based on the user responses. As a software developer, from creating this application, I was able to execute javascript programs outside of the browser using Nodejs, which helped my understanding of how we can create programs with javascript to automate tedious and time consuming processes.
